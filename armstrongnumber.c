/*
Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 
153=1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 that 153 is Armstrong number.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and controls whether it is armstrong or not. 
According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of userâ€™s input
