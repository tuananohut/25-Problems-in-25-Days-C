/*
A composite number is a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying two smaller positive 
integers. Equivalently, it is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself. 
An example of a composite number is 6. It can be divided by not only 1 and 6 but also by 2 
and 3.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and finds smallest composite number greater 
than the given number. According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. 
Program terminates when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not 
forget to control suitability of userâ€™s input.
