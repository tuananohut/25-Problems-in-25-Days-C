/*
Co-prime numbers are the numbers whose common factor is only 1. There should be a 
minimum of two numbers to form a set of co-prime numbers. Such numbers have only 1 as 
their highest common factor, for example, {4 and 7}, {5, 7, 9} are co-prime numbers. Co-prime 
numbers need not be prime numbers always.
Write a program that takes two numbers from a user and controls whether they are coprime or 
not. 
According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of userâ€™s input.
