/*
A number is called Disarium number if the sum of its power of the positions from left to right is 
equal to the number. Example: 1 + 3*3 + 5*5*5 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135
Write a program that takes a three-digit number from a user and controls whether it is disarium 
or not. According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program 
terminates when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to 
control suitability of userâ€™s input.
