/*
In mathematics, a harshad number (or Niven number) in a given number base is 
an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. For instance, 24 is harshard number because 
24 is divisible by 2+4=6.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and controls whether it is harshard or not. 
According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of userâ€™s input.
