/*
In arithmetic and number theory, the least common multiple, lowest common multiple, 
or smallest common multiple of two integers a and b, usually denoted by lcm(a, b), is the 
smallest positive integer that is divisible by both a and b. For instance, lcm of 8 and 12 is 24.
Write a program that takes two numbers from a user and finds their least common multiple. 
According to found result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates when 
user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control suitability 
of userâ€™s input.
