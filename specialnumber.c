/*
A number is said to be special number when the sum of factorial of its digits is equal to the 
number itself. Example- 145 is a Special Number as 1!+4!+5!=145.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and controls whether it is special or not. 
According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of userâ€™s input.
