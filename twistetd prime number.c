/*
A number is said to be twisted prime if it is a prime number and reverse of the number is also 
a prime number. An example of a twisted prime number is 13 because both 13 and 31 are 
prime numbers.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and controls whether it is twisted prime or 
not. According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of userâ€™s input.
