/*
In number theory, Wagstaff prime is a prime number of the form (2n+1)/3. For instance 11 is 
Wagstaff prime because it is prime number and it can be written as (25 + 1)/3.
Write a program that takes a number from a user and controls whether it is Wagstaff or not. 
According to control result, program returns an appropriate message. Program terminates 
when user enters -1 otherwise asks new number after each return. Do not forget to control 
suitability of userâ€™s input.
